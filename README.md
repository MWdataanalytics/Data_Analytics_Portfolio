# Data Analytics Portfolio by Matt Winkler
This portfolio is a compilation of jupyter notebooks, written in python, that showcases the various data analytics projects I've been working on these past few months. The following data analytics skills are put into practice to draw insights from a variety of data sources:
* Exploratory Data Analysis
* Data Visualization
* Data Merging 
* Data Cleaning
* Web Scraping

Presidential election data is explored, focusing mainly on state vote margin shifts between the 2012 and 2016 elections. Data is pulled from a variety of sources to visualize vote margin shifts for all 50 states and analyze the factors that contributed to these shifts in the 2016 election.

Building upon my <i>State Vote Shifts in Recent Presidential Elections</i> project, 2012 and 2016 presidential election results are gathered for every US county by web scraping the New York Times' website. Vote shifts are visualized using a variety of plotting tools to explore the increasing rural-urban divide in American politics.

Web scraping is used to gather post-graduate reports spanning the years 2004-2017 from my alma mater, Virginia Tech. This data, which includes number of grads, employment rate, and starting salaries, is visualized to compare majors and uncover starting salary trends.

This project was inspired by the <i>FiveThirtyEight</i> article, "<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/dear-mona-followup-where-do-people-drink-the-most-beer-wine-and-spirits/">Dear Mona Followup: Where Do People Drink The Most Beer, Wine And Spirits?</a>". Plotly is used to take this data one step further and map world beer, wine, spirits, and total alcohol consumption around the world.
